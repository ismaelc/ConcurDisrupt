<a name="what-is-concur" class="anchor" href="#what-is-concur"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Concur?</h2>

<p>If you've heard of TripIt, then there's a remote chance you've heard of us. We help 25M business travelers manage their travel bookings and expense reports through the Concur Travel and Expense web/mobile app.  This allows them and their companies to save time, money, gain visibility and enforce employee compliance on expenses.  It's all about giving the business traveler a delightful and worry-free travel experience, which we like to call <em>The Perfect Trip</em>.</p>

<p>We also created APIs so that partners can add value and contribute to a business traveler's Perfect Trip.  That's where you come in.</p>

<p><strong>Example apps</strong></p>

<p>Before we get to that question, here are 2 examples of what our partners have built using Concur APIs.  They're all listed in our <a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center">App Center</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/partners/transaction-capture/traveltext">TravelText</a> - TravelText allows you to text your expenses right into Concur. No more paper receipts and Excel sheet mayhem!  Don't believe us?  Check out their video demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxY_PO-QKZ0">here</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nDhf34TiiC9RCocFM2xViin5c/Trover">Trover</a> - it's travel photography + business travel integration in one great app. Because we understand that the business traveler is a person too. Quoting from this <a href="http://skift.com/2013/07/25/travel-photography-app-trover-secures-2-5-million-in-funding-from-concur/#/0">article</a>, what they get for integrating with Concur is <em>"being able to tap into Concur’s experience, knowledge and “great visibility into travel patterns”"</em>.</li>
</ul><p><strong>APIs</strong></p>

<p>You can find more examples of apps that use our APIs in the App Center link above.  Now let's get to business - what information can you get from the Concur APIs?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.concur.com/api-documentation/web-services/itinerary/itinerary-resource/itinerary-resource-get#getitindetails">Itinerary Details of a Concur user</a> - there's a ton of information you can get from a Concur user's trip, such as the booking segments the trip, whether it's Air, Car, Hotel, Dining, Ride, Rail, or Parking.  The most common information you'll probably use is a user's travel destination.  From that single piece of info, you can make recommendations to the traveler.  In fact that's what Trover is doing.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.concur.com/api-documentation/web-services/expense-report/expense-report-resource/get-report-digests">Expense data history of a Concur user</a> - users of Concur expense their purchases using the Concur Travel and Expense web/mobile app, so that they can get reimbursed by their company at the end of the trip.  This gives Concur insight into a user's expense pattern (<em>e.g. does Joe always get a Starbucks coffee right after landing in SFO?</em>). This API returns a collection of expense reports that you can use to make the same deduction.  It's also worth noting that there are also APIs to submit expense <a href="https://www.concursolutions.com/api/docs/index.html#!/Entries/Post_content_user_post_2">entries</a> (e.g. Starbucks coffee, printer ink, etc) and <a href="https://developer.concur.com/api-documentation/web-services/expense-report">reports</a> (collection of expense entries), as well as <a href="https://www.concursolutions.com/api/docs/index.html#!/ReceiptImages">submit images</a> of receipts (similar to TravelText above).</li>
</ul><p><em>We know you're tempted to stop reading and start coding after clicking those API docs links, but please read on to find out more on how you can win this... ;)</em></p>
